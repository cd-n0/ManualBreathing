### WEWOWEEEWEWOEWO
Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and writing minecraft mods in Java  
Amateur artist and developer  
Somewhat great of an editor  
You can reach me by sending me an e-mail

**If you need a script, mod, or a tool I wrote, and want me to upload it here, notify me about it. I would probably upload it in the same week of you asking, if I'm not busy.**
